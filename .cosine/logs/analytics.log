These cards should clearly show the structure of the JSON, with sub-objects and arrays formatted to indicate their nesting levels. Use visual elements like indents or tags to help show the relationships between different parts of the JSON data.\n\nRemember, the JSON generator produces a list of dictionary objects, and you need to make a separate card for each dictionary in the list.\n\nGuidelines for Implementation: Construct a Card component that formats and styles the JSON content. Use visual indentation, like tree views, to represent nested objects and arrays. Keep the design clean and minimalistic, ensuring readability of the JSON content. Optionally, use collapsible sections for deeply nested structures to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.\n\nhelp me with this","agent":"cosine-vscode","version":"1.1.2","package":"@cosine/analytics"}
